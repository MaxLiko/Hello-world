# My notes:

## Github tutorial:


##### Reposatory (Project)
	[should be initialized with a readme to discribe the project]

##### Branch (different versions/coppys than "master" repsitory)
	* main branch is called "master"
	* new branch is called "feature" (used to test new features)

##### Commit (saved changes to GitHub-file)
	should have a associated "commit message" which describes the change (others should understand it)

##### Pull Request (compare commited code to other code)
	* proposal to someone to review and pull your change into there branch
	* the pull request can differenciat (diffs) from both branches
	* changes/additions/subtractions shown in green and red

	[if features are sucessfull they will be added to the master branch]
